                </h2>
                <p>
                    Yngwie Johan Malmsteen was born Lars Johan Yngve Lannerb√§ck, on 30 June 1963.
                    Pro tip: you have to say his name so it sounds like ingvay!<br><br>

                    He is a Swedish guitarist who first became known in the 1980s for his neoclassical playing style in
                    heavy metal, and has released 22 studio albums in a career spanning over 40 years. In August 2009,
                    Time
                    magazine named Malmsteen No. 9 on its list of the 10 best electric guitar players of all-time.
                    not too bad at all!

                    In early 1982, Mike Varney of Shrapnel Records, who had heard a demo tape of Malmsteen's playing
                    from
                    the 1978 demo titled Powerhouse, brought Malmsteen to the United States. He played briefly with the
                    band
                    Steeler on its 1983 self-titled album. Then in one of the most amazing debut albums of all time,
                    Malmsteen appeared with Graham Bonnet in the band Alcatrazz, playing on its 1983 album No Parole
                    from
                    Rock 'n' Roll. It was a formidable and sublime performance. The quality of the riffs and guitar
                    solos
                    was unparalleled and breathtakingly original. As Malmsteen was classically inspired he brought a new
                    fresh sound to guitar playing which combined edgy hard rock and the melodious arrangement of notes.
                    Graham Bonnet's unique and gritty vocal style and his thought-provoking lyrics combined with
                    Malmsteen's
                    powerful performance to create albums with unforgettable and dynamic songs.
